// NEXT STEPS
// [ ] demux.spec.ts contains a prototype for a stub implementation (ServerStub)
//     => let the IDL compiler generate it (write the code directly into the X_stub.ts)
// [ ] orb.ts socketRcvd() contains a hardcoded part to call ServerImpl
//     => let the IDL compiler generate it (here we need a data structure/object the orb can lookup)
//     write it into X_skel.ts, maybe as static data directly into the skeleton class
// [ ] orb.ts constains lots of json related code to be thrown away

// *.ts            interface
// *_value.ts      this was the place where we had the
