//        we would also want to do that anyway in case network errors bring the connection down
// FIXME: the ORB should also check for timeouts
// FIXME: there are basically 4 connection modes for IIOP
//        * unidirectional
//          * server listens
//          * in case of callback: server connects to client's server port
//        * bidirectional
//        => the orb needs a connect(hostname, port) to be able to initiate
//           connections on it's own
