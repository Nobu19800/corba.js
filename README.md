# glue.js
Welcome to the glue.js, an Object Request Broker (ORB) and Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler

This library is currently being written to develop <a href="https://github.com/markandre13/workflow">workflow - A collaborative real-time white- and kanban board</a>.

The IDL takes some inspiration from the CORBA IDL.

The protocol takes some inspiration from JSON-RPC.
